Limits access to wp-admin and wp-login.php also provides a sign-in shortcut

== Description ==
Limits access to wp-admin and wp-login.php also provides a sign-in shortcut

Use scenario: WordPress as a CMS with "administrator" accounts only. To make logins even more secure, consider making the "Sign In" page protected. 

* When not logged in, it prevents any and all access to the admin area, or any related URLs .. such as /wp-login.php etc.
* It provides a shortcode that can be added to a sign-in page, to allow logging in from the front-end.

*WARNING*: When the plugin is activated, access to the normal login for WordPress is disabled.  To allow login access, create a page, for example “Sign In”, and add the shortcode [login_form].

== Installation ==
Use standard WordPress installation

Nothing special.  

*** BEFORE YOU ACTIVATE ***

Just make sure you have the [login_form] shortcode on a page.
